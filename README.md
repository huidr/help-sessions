## Help Sessions

### [IISERM IDC101 Introduction to Computers](idc101)

Solutions for lab sessions
- [Lab session 1](idc101/session-1)
- [Lab session 2](idc101/session-2)
- [Lab session 3](idc101/session-3)

[Bash: cheatsheet](idc101/README.md) covers syntax for the course. This should be sufficient to solve the assignment problems.

### [IISERM MTH101 Symmetry](mth101)

[Concepts Made Easy](mth101/README.md) is a bird's eye view of some fundamental concepts in symmetry and group theory explained through intuitive analogies. The following are the topics covered.

- Group theory

  - [Preserve group structure through homomorphisms](mth101/README.md#preserve-group-structure-through-homomorphisms)
  - [Isomorphisms make the universe of groups smaller](mth101/README.md#isomorphisms-make-the-universe-of-groups-smaller)
  - [Turn any homomorphism into an isomorphism](mth101/README.md#turn-any-homomorphism-into-an-isomorphism)

  - [New groups from old ones by taking quotients](mth101/README.md#new-groups-from-old-ones-by-taking-quotients)
  - [Every group is simply a permutation group](mth101/README.md#every-group-is-simply-a-permutation-group)
